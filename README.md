Split panoramas for Instagram

## Details

This is a client-side `VueJS` application

It splits a panorama into multiple square images which can then be posted on Instagram to create a "slideshow" post which recreates the original panorama

The app uses `canvas` to manipulate the images, avoiding downloads of any user images to a server

## Contributing
